# MCTS-Nogo
Nogo4 is a Nogo player using Monte Carlo Tree Search and UCT algorithm, with a module for playing games of Go using GoTextProtocol.

Also included the code for a random Nogo player and a flat Monte Carlo Nogo player, and a play.py file that enables playing games between these players and see the results.

I plan to keep updating Nogo4 so that it becomes stronger in playing Nogo.
